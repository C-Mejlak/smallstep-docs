description: Basic Certificate Operations with Certificate Manager 
---

In this documentation, we will explore basic certificate operations using the [`step`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli) command-line tool. 
`step` acts as a front-end interface to certificate manager and is used for many common crypto and X.509 operations.
This tutorial covers:

1. Creating a certificate
2. Inspecting a certificate
3. Renewing a certificate
4. Revoking a certificate

### Before you begin
This tutorial assumes you have created a Smallstep Team and a Certificate Manager Authority using the steps in [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx).

### step 1 - Create a test certificate

With an Authority created and your local client configured,
you can create a test certificate by running the `step ca certificate` command.
Here is an example:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca certificate myservice myservice.crt myservice.key --san myservice.internal.mycompany.net --not-after 24h">
  {`$ step ca certificate myservice myservice.crt myservice.key --san myservice.internal.mycompany.net --not-after 24h`}
</CodeBlock>

In this command, we are asking the CA to create a certificate with the following properties
* `myservice` - The certificate's subject
* `myservice.crt` - Save the certificate in a file with this name
* `myservice.key` - Save the key in a file with this name
* `--san myservice.internal.mycompany.net` - Add an additional SAN to the certificate, with the specified value
* `--not-after 24h` - Set the certificate to expire after 24 hours

When you run this command, it will envoke the `authority-admin` provisioner and start a single sign-on flow via the smallstep dashboard.
After a successful sign-in, the authority will issue the certificate. 

### Step 2 - Inspect a test certificate
You can inspect your certificate by running:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt">
{`$ step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt`}
</CodeBlock>

It should look similar to this.

```bash
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2441...2018]
  Subject:     myservice
               admin@yourco.com
               https://auth.smallstep.com#98496ed4-7f27-4367-b7a2-ef828e0a4eda
  Issuer:      Dev Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: authority-admin [ID: 909d...8521]
  Valid from:  2021-10-04T21:30:12Z
          to:  2021-10-05T21:31:12Z
```

### step 3 - renew a certificate
Certificates expire. 
Certificate Manager makes renewing a certificate ahead of expiration easy. 
Renewals are authenticated using your existing certificate and produce an identical certificate with a new serial number and extended lifetime.
The private key is unchanged.

In its most primitive form, renewal is a simple single-command operation:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca renew myservice.crt myservice.key">
  {`$ step ca renew myservice.crt myservice.key`}
</CodeBlock>

More than a dozen [command-line flags](../step-cli/reference/ca/renew) make `step ca renew` flexible and easy to integrate into almost any operational environment.

Inspect your certificate again, and you will see it has an extended lifetime. 

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt">
{`$ step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2441...2018]
  Subject:     myservice
               admin@yourco.com
               https://auth.smallstep.com#98496ed4-7f27-4367-b7a2-ef828e0a4eda
  Issuer:      Dev Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: authority-admin [ID: 909d...8521]
  Valid from:  2021-10-04T21:32:34Z
          to:  2021-10-05T21:33:34Z`}
</CodeBlock>


### step 4 - revoke a certificate

Certificate Manager uses passive revocation by default. 
To passively revoke a certificate means to block its renewal at the CA. 
This eliminates the additional network requests when using active revocation, because the certificate expires by itself. 
With passive revocation, certificates cannot be immediately revoked. 
Therefore, certificates should have a shorter life to reduce the value of a key that has been exfiltrated.
To revoke a certificate, run the following operation.

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca revoke --cert=myservice.crt --key=myservice.key">
{`$ step ca revoke --cert=myservice.crt --key=myservice.key
âœ” CA: https://your.authority.ca.smallstep.com
Certificate with Serial Number 215963883671773554731824269659406308792 has been revoked.`}
</CodeBlock>

Upon expiry, this certificate will no longer be valid.
If you try to renew the certificate, it will fail.

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca renew myservice.crt myservice.key">
{`$ step ca renew myservice.crt myservice.key
error renewing certificate: The request lacked necessary authorization to be completed. Please see the certificate authority logs for more info.`}
</CodeBlock>

Passive revocation doesn't use Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Signing Protocol (OCSP) like Web PKI.

Certificate Manager also supports CRL and OCSP, when used with an Advanced Authority.
