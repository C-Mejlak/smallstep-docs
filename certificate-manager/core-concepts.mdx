---

The Smallstep Platform is powered by a number of components that can be combined to deliver automated certificate management for a broad set of use cases and implementations. 

# Certificates

A **certificate** is a sort of credential. Concretely, a certificate is a data
structure that contains a name, public key, validity period (a.k.a., lifetime),
and additional metadata. Certificates are **signed** by a trusted **certificate
authority** (CA) and issued to **endpoints**. A **relying party** validates a
certificate and extracts the **subject name** to authenticate the identity of an
endpoint.

# Endpoints

An **Endpoint** is an entity (person, device, workload) that is issued a
certificate. Certificate Manager attempts to group certificate renewals for an
Endpoint for alerting, audit, and billing purposes.

Certificate Manager can be configured to alert you when an Endpoint’s last
certificate is approaching expiry and has not been renewed.

The Certificate Manager dashboard provides an Endpoint detail view that makes it
easy for administrators to view the historical certificate lineage for an
Endpoint. This aggregated view simplifies operations, auditing, reporting, and
compliance inquiries.

Certificate Manager billing is also metered on Endpoint-months.

- Billing starts when a certificate is issued for a new Endpoint
- Billing ends when an Endpoint’s last certificate expires or is revoked

Billing per-certificate would penalize deployments that use short-lived
certificates and automated renewal. Endpoint billing is designed to encourage
this best practice.

Two Endpoint examples:

1. A single device with **one 30-day certificate** would be billed at the same
   rate as,
2. A single device with **60 one-day certificates** renewed every 12-hours.

**Endpoint** grouping is automatic and intuitive for most use cases:

- For provisioners with renewal enabled:
  - Certificates issued using `step ca certificate` (or any other method that
    uses the `/sign` API) create a new Endpoint
  - Certificates issued using `step ca renew` (or any other method that uses the
    `/renew` API) are associated with the existing Endpoint of the certificate
    that’s being renewed
- For provisioners with renewal disabled, common with ACME and OIDC,
  certificates with identical subjects (common name and SANs), ignoring order
  and capitalization, belong to the same Endpoint

For billing purposes, there is a limit of three active certificates per
Endpoint. Each active certificate above three is billed as an additional
Endpoint. To avoid being charged for multiple Endpoints you can revoke unused
certificates after they’ve been renewed.

If you’d like to opt-in to certificate-based billing, inquire about high-volume
fixed pricing, or have any other questions about Endpoint-based billing for your
use case please [contact us](mailto:support@smallstep.com).

# Authorities

Authorities are the foundation of the Smallstep Platform. They are trusted services that provide core certificate signing and management functions (issue, sign, renew, and revoke certificates), and can run at any level of the PKI trust chain. Authorities are
highly configurable, and multiple authorities can be used together to meet
complex requirements.

There are different types of authorities supported:

## Issuing Authorities

An **issuing authority** is an online certificate authority that authenticates
and authorizes certificate requests and issues certificates. Issuing authorities
sign certificates themselves. To do so, they are provisioned with a special CA
certificate and private key.

There are two types of issuing authority:

1. **Hosted**: run by smallstep on your behalf as part of your Certificate
   Manager account.
2. **Linked**: an instance of `step-ca` you run that connects to your
   Certificate Manager account for reporting, alerting, revocation, and other
   managed services.

If an issuing authority's private key is compromised, it can be used to
maliciously issue certificates that will be trusted by the rest of your
infrastructure. To protect these keys, `step-ca` integrates with hardware and
software key managers, including PKCS#11 Hardware Security Modules (HSMs),
YubiKeys, and cloud key management systems (KMSs) from AWS, GCP, and Azure. For
hosted authorities, smallstep secures these keys for you in GCP's CloudKMS, with
options for software or FIPS 140-2 Level 3 hardware protection levels.

## Root CA 
At the bottom of the PKI trust chain is the root authority. Typically, a Root CA is only invoked to sign intermediate CA certificates. 
This indirection allows for redundant topologies and facilitates migrations. 
It also means root CA private keys can be managed, stored, and accessed with more care. 

For the most security-sensitive use cases root signing keys can even be kept offline in a physically secure environment.
A **root CA** is _directly_ trusted by relying parties. The root CA's
certificate must be deployed to VMs, devices, and containers, then software and
systems must be configured to trust it.

## Intermediate CA 
Automated certificate management requires an online CA with an API that's capable of authenticating certificate signing requests (CSRs) and issuing certificates. 
An intermediate CA (also called a **subordinate CA**) is an issuing CA which recursively _chains up_ to the root CA. It is used to sign and issue certificates for devices, people, workloads, or whatever else you need to identify. It also allows you to keep your root signing keys offline, which improves security.

For most scenarios, this is a nuance you won't have to worry about. By default,
Certificate Manager will create a non-issuing root CA and a separate issuing
authority for you automatically. For advanced scenarios, you can use your own
offline root CA, provision multiple issuing authorities from a single root,
configure multiple levels of intermediates, and revoke and re-issue intermediate
authority certificates as necessary.

## Registration Authority
A registration authority is an online service that accepts and authenticates certificate requests. But, instead of issuing certificates itself, a registration authority passes authentic requests to an
issuing authority (an Intermediate CA or Root CA) to sign and catalog. Registration authorities support all Provisioner types and are an optional component. They deliver most of the benefits of a
linked issuing authority with less operational complexity since there's no
signing key to manage.   
Registration Authorities are also useful for connecting remote sites to a central set of signing authorities.

![ACME Registration Authority](/graphics/ia-cloud-ra-challenge-client.svg 'In this example, the Smallstep ACME RA runs within the local network or VPC and responds to ACME requests from internal infrastructure and workloads. The RA accepts ACME orders and authenticates requests by verifying an ACME challenge. Upon verification, a CSR is securely passed to the Issuing Authority to sign and catalog.')

## Validation Authorities

A validation authority distributes certificate revocation status. Validation
authorities implement two open standards to support active revocation:

- **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**: a signed, immutable ledger that lists
  the serial number of all revoked certificates. CRLs are signed by trusted
  infrastructure and served from cloud storage for high performance and
  availability.
- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)**: a standard API for requesting
  the revocation status of a particular certificate. The Certificate Manager
  OCSP responder is a shared-nothing service that uses CRLs as a data source.

# Provisioners

Provisioners verify the legitimacy of certificate signing requests and attest to the identity of the requesting service or human. Provisioners are used to bootstrap new entities into the PKI, and make it easy to automate certificate management where
possible, and support semi-automated / self-serve workflows where required.

Certificate lifetimes, access control policies, renewal, templates, and many
other options are configurable per-provisioner. Since an issuing authority can
have multiple provisioners, you implement complex authentication and
authorization policies and issue different kinds of certificates from one
issuing authority.

Each Provisioner addresses a particular environment, enabling different use cases. 
 A few examples include:

- **OIDC Provisioner** - Useful for getting certificates to people, 
the OAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provisioner uses identity tokens for authentication. 
With this provisioner, you can use single sign-on with Google Workspace, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, or any other OAuth OIDC provider 
to verify the user's identity before issuing a certificate.
- **ACME Provisioner** - Useful for automating TLS certificates, 
the ACME provisioner provides CSR generation, domain ownership verification, certificate download, and installation. 
With support for all of the ACME challenge types supported by Let’s Encrypt (HTTP, DNS, ALPN), 
the ACME provisioner unlocks the entire ACME ecosystem of tools and clients.
- **Cloud API Provisioners** - Useful for issuing certificates to public cloud virtual machines, 
Cloud API Provisioners use the native cloud provider API and instance identity documents to automate certificates. 
With support for AWS, GCP, and Azure metadata APIs, the Cloud API provisioner accelerates secure cloud operations.
- **JWK Provisioner** - Useful for a broad range of workflows, the JWK provisioner provides a flexible JSON Web Token-based authentication flow. 
Often paired with infrastructure automation solutions, the JWK Provisioner can deliver one-time tokens to a new workload to later be exchanged for an x.509 certificate.
- **The `X5C` and `SSHPOP` provisioners** - Useful for getting short-lived device certificates. These provisioners let you get a certificate
  using an existing x509 or SSH certificate issued from another authority. This
  can be used by devices to exchange long-lived _birth certificates_ issued at
  manufacture time for short-lived _workload certificates_ and for other
  _derived credential_ workflows where a certificate from a canonical CA is used
  to automatically obtain certificates from one or more special-purpose CA(s).

# Inventories

Inventories are catalogs or lists of entities like hosts, services, locations, or people. 
Inventories provide a secure mapping between details that are available from the credential used to request a certificate 
and additional metadata that needs to be bound in the issued certificate. 
You can use Inventories along with other Smallstep Platform components to:

- **Customize Certificates** - An inventory can map the hostname of a VM to the name of a workload running on that VM, or map an email address to a POSIX username. 
In both cases, the name in the authentication credential used to request a certificate does not match the name that should be in the issued certificate.
- **Authorize Certificate Requests** - Inventory metadata can also be used to authorize a certificate request. For example, certificate issuance via the OIDC provisioner can be restricted to a particular subdomain based on group membership information maintained in a user inventory.

# Templates

Templates give you granular control over certificate details and can be used to customize x.509 or SSH certificates for any use case. 
By default,
Certificate Manager is tuned to issue short-lived certificates for use with TLS.
Templates let you customize every detail of a certificate, down to the
[OID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_identifier), to support any use case.
With Templates, you can add custom SANs or extensions to:

- Customize certificates for a broad range of applications and integrations.
- Provides full control of all of certificate fields, even add custom extensions.
- Automate custom certificate generation and skip the manual workflows.

Concretely, a template is a JSON representation of a certificate that's
materialized using Go's [`text/template`](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)
module and [sprig functions](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/). They look
like this:

![Certificate Templates](/graphics/templates-screenshot.svg 'Certificate Templates')

Context from certificate requests and authentication credentials are made
available as template variables, so you can adjust certificate details based on
who's requesting the certificate.
