In this guide,
we'll talk about different approaches you can take
as you build yout device inventory in Smallstep.

It's worth restating the overall goal of this process:
To build a high-assurance device inventory,
so that only your organization's devices
can access protected resources.

While a lot of organizations
have device inventories in various locations
(IT Asset Management systems, device management platforms, etc),
these are not usually high-assurance inventories.
Smallstep uses hardware identifiers
and device attestation
to help you develop a high-assurance inventory
that can be the foundation for device authentication.

There's a few ways to bring devices into your Smallstep inventory:

### Self-enrollment

You can [manually invite users
to join your Smallstep team](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/users/invite),
and they will be able to self-enroll devices
using the [Smallstep Desktop App](./smallstep-app.mdx)
or the [Smallstep Agent for Linux](./smallstep-agent.mdx).

As the administrator,
by default,
you must approve each new device
before it can access any of your resources.
You can change this in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

### Connect Smallstep to your identity provider

This option requires IdP self-enrollment in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team) to be enabled.
It is disabled by default.

When you connect Smallstep to your identity provider,
your users will be able to self-enroll
via single sign-on,
using the [Smallstep Desktop App](./smallstep-app.mdx)
or the [Smallstep Agent for Linux](./smallstep-agent.mdx).

As the administrator,
by default,
you must approve each new device
before it can access any of your resources.
You can change this in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

### Sync Smallstep to an MDM

You can sync your existing MDM inventories into Smallstep.
Once an MDM is synced,
you can deploy the Smallstep Agent to your endpoints
to enable high-assurance protections.

Devices synced from an MDM inventory do not require manual approval.
But, they will not be marked as high-assurance until Smallstep receives an attestation from the device.

For a concrete example,
see [Connect Jamf Pro to Smallstep](../tutorials/connect-jamf-pro-to-smallstep.mdx)


### Add devices via API

You can import devices from any source into Smallstep using our API.

Devices added via API do not require manual approval.
But, they will not be marked as high-assurance until Smallstep receives an attestation from the device.

#### Example: I have a list of device identifiers

For each device, use the [Save Collection Instance](https://gateway.smallstep.com/v2023-11-01/operations/PutCollectionInstance) endpoint to create a device.
- For the `collectionSlug`, use `default`
- For Apple devices, the `instanceID` must be the device's serial number.
- For TPM 2.0 devices, the `instanceID` must be the TPM Endorsement Key URI, in the format `urn:ek:sha256:ul3sYf6uQ6jVEXAMPLEXoAuHI10U8gTvEJ6bMj95LXI=`. (You can retrieve the EK URI by running `step agent tpm --fingerprint` on the device.)

For the body of the request, use the following value, replacing `carl@smallstep.com` with the device owner's email address:

```
{ "data": { "smallstep:identity": "carl@smallstep.com" } }
```

Once added, you'll see the device in your Smallstep dashboard, under Recent Devices, and it will be automatically approved.
