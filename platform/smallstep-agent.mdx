The Smallstep Agent for Linux is a background component of the [Smallstep Desktop App](./smallstep-app.mdx).
Choose one or the other depending on your deployment needs.

# Introduction

While macOS and Windows can manage certificates and authentication settings via Mobile Device Management (MDM), Linux does not include automated remote management facilities. The Smallstep Agent brings vital certificate management features to your Linux users and endpoints. It can be installed independently on any Linux device running systemd.

In this document, we will install, configure, and start the Smallstep Agent on a Linux device running systemd. We also show how to use the agentâ€™s built-in PKCS#11 (smart card) service. With the PKCS#11 service, you can access Smallstep certificates and keys from applications that support PKCS#11.

# System Requirements

- Supported operating systems:
    - Enterprise Linux (RHEL, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux, Alma Linux, etc)
    - Ubuntu (Current Stable and LTS)
    - Debian (Current Releases)
    - Fedora (Current Releases)
- A TPM 2.0 module is required. Smallstep depends on TPMs to create a high-assurance device inventory.
- We support `amd64` and `arm64` architectures
 The following directories are used by default:
    - runtime state in `/run/step-agent`
    - configuration in `/etc/step-agent`
    - certificates in`/var/lib/step-agent` and in your configured locations
- The agent will connect to the following Smallstep hosts:
    - Your CA:  `<your-team>.ca.smallstep.com` and subdomains
    - Agent API: `control.infra.smallstep.com`
    - Smallstep API: `gateway.smallstep.com`
    - TPM Attestation CA: `att.smallstep.com`

## Register the endpoint

### Auto-registration

To configure the agent and register your Linux device with your Smallstep team, run:

```jsx
sudo step-agent-plugin register [team name]
```

### Manual registration

Alternatively, you can configure the agent manually:
1. First, [register and approve your devices via API](./enrollment-guide.mdx#add-devices-via-api).
2. On your endpoints, update the `/etc/step-agent/agent.yaml` config file with your Smallstep team name and Smallstep Agent CA fingerprint.

   ```jsx
   team: "myteamname"
   fingerprint: "40523785c1d1d11EXAMPLE017b660d52a5fa5f2cb94cf0e1a9e9209dbea0826"
   ```

   - Your `team` ID (team slug). This is the value after `/app/` in your Smallstep dashboard URL.
   - Your agent CA `fingerprint`. Find this value in your dashboard:
       - In the Smallstep dashboard, select Authorities
       - Select the Smallstep Agents authority
       - Use the sha256 Root fingerprint displayed on this page


## Start the agent

Finally, enable and start the agent:

```jsx
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now step-agent
```

If you get any errors, check the agentâ€™s status:

```jsx
sudo systemctl status step-agent.service
```

## **PKCS#11 Support**

The Smallstep agent provides a PKCS#11 server that can be used for a variety of integration use cases, such as NetworkManager and `wpa_supplicant` connections or web browser certificates. The PKCS#11 server is exposed as a UNIX socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/step-agent/step-agent-pkcs11.sock`. 

### Example usage: Google Chrome

For this example, weâ€™re using Ubuntu 24.04. The location of `p11-kit-client.so` may vary.

Letâ€™s make client certificates and keys from the agent available to Google Chrome via PKCS#11 tokens. We will use `modutil` and an NSS database. Google Chrome defaults to storing an NSS database in `~/.pki/nssdb`, so we can leverage that.

To use Smallstep certificates in Chrome, run:

```
modutil -dbdir ~/.pki/nssdb -add step-agent \
        -libfile /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/p11-kit-client.so
export P11_KIT_SERVER_ADDRESS=unix:path=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/step-agent/step-agent-pkcs11.sock
```

Next, start Chrome from the command line.

In Chrome, you should now have access to certificates managed by Smallstep.

For regular usage, add `P11_KIT_SERVER_ADDRESS` to your environment more permanently. For example, you might add `P11_KIT_SERVER_ADDRESS=unix:path=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/step-agent/step-agent-pkcs11.sock`  to your global `/etc/environment` file.

### Troubleshooting

The agent produces a log file or journal entries in systemd, depending on how it is installed and run.

You can use tools like `pkcs11-tool` for troubleshooting PKCS#11 support:

```bash
pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/p11-kit-client.so \
         --list-slots
```

See the [p11-kit](https://p11-glue.github.io/p11-glue/p11-kit/manual/) documentation for more details.
