description: The Smallstep platform is used across security, IT, and DevOps teams to enable end-to-end network encryption, privileged access management, passwordless authentication, and much more.

With the Smallstep API, you can manage:

- Devices in your Smallstep inventory
- High-level protected resources, such as Wi-Fi or VPN configurations
- Lower-level PKI resources like X.509 CAs and provisioners
- [Smallstep SSH](../ssh/README.mdx) hosts, host grants, and tags (use the [2023-11-01](https://gateway.smallstep.com/v2023-11-01) API version for this)
- And more!

The Smallstep API is [OpenAPI conformant](https://www.openapis.org/), with JSON requests and responses.

### Smallstep API Setup and Usage

ðŸ‘‰ [Smallstep API Specification and Playground](https://gateway.smallstep.com/v2025-01-01)

You can get an API token in two ways:
- **Smallstep UI**: [Add a token in Smallstep settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/api/tokens/add). You can choose the validity period and scopes here.
- **Command Line**: On the command line, using the [`step` CLI](../step-cli/README.mdx). The [`step api token create`](../step-cli/reference/api/token/create/README.mdx) command accepts a client certificate and private key to authenticate with Smallstep and issue a temporary API token with a 1 hour validity period.
  To use this option, you must [configure one or more trusted root CAs in the Smallstep UI](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/api/trusted-roots/edit). Trusted roots can be Smallstep CAs or external CAs.

### API Clients

- [Smallstep API Python Client](https://github.com/smallstep/smallstep-python)
- [Smallstep Terraform Provider](https://github.com/smallstep/terraform-provider-smallstep) ([Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/smallstep/smallstep/latest/docs))

### Example: Add devices via the API

You can import devices from any source into Smallstep using our API.

Devices added via API are automatically approved.
but they will not be marked as high-assurance
until Smallstep receives an attestation from the device.

Use the [Add Device](https://gateway.smallstep.com/v2025-01-01/operations/PostDevices) endpoint to create a device.
- For Apple devices, the `permanentIdentifier` must be the device's 9-character serial number.
- For TPM 2.0 devices, the `permanentIdentifier` must be the TPM Endorsement Key URI, in the format `urn:ek:sha256:ul3sYf6uQ6jVEXAMPLEXoAuHI10U8gTvEJ6bMj95LXI=`. (You can retrieve the EK URI by running `step agent tpm --fingerprint` on the device.)
- To create and assign a user to a device, fill in the `user` fields.

Once added,
the devices will be automatically approved.

You can see the device using the [List Devices](https://gateway.smallstep.com/v2025-01-01/operations/ListDevices) endpoint:

```bash
set +o history
echo "Authorization: Bearer [your API token]" > api_headers
set -o history
curl -sH @api_headers --request GET \
  --url https://gateway.smallstep.com/api/devices \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'x-smallstep-api-version: 2025-01-01' | jq
```

Or, in your Smallstep dashboard,
you'll see the device listed under Recent Devices.
