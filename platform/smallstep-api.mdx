description: The Smallstep platform is used across security, IT, and DevOps teams to enable end-to-end network encryption, privileged access management, passwordless authentication, and much more.

With the Smallstep API, you can:

- Register new devices in your Smallstep inventory
- Manage your high-level protected resources, such as Wi-Fi or VPN configurations
- Manage low-level resources like X.509 CAs, Attestation authorities, and provisioners
- Manage hosts, host grants, and tags for [Smallstep SSH](../ssh/README.mdx)
- And more!

The Smallstep API is [OpenAPI conformant](https://www.openapis.org/), with JSON requests and responses.

### Smallstep API Setup and Usage

ðŸ‘‰ [Smallstep API Specification and Playground](https://gateway.smallstep.com)

You can get an API token in two ways:
- In your [Smallstep settings](https://smallstep.com/app?next=/settings). Under **API Tokens**, choose **+ Add Token.**
- On the command line, using the [`step` CLI](../step-cli/README.mdx). The [`step api token create`](../step-cli/reference/api/token/create/README.mdx) command accepts a client certificate and private key to authenticate with Smallstep and issue a temporary API token. To use this option, you must first configure a trusted root CA in your [Smallstep settings](https://smallstep.com/app?next=/settings). The trusted root can be a Smallstep CA or an external CA. Only one trusted root CA may be configured.

Your API token has a 10 year validity period and will only be displayed once. Please store it in a safe place!

### API Clients

- [Smallstep Terraform Provider](https://github.com/smallstep/terraform-provider-smallstep) ([Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/smallstep/smallstep/latest/docs))
- [Smallstep API Python Client](https://github.com/smallstep/smallstep-python)

]
```

### Example: Add devices via the API

You can import devices from any source into Smallstep using our API.

Devices added via API are automatically approved.
but they will not be marked as high-assurance
until Smallstep receives an attestation from the device.

#### Example: I have a list of device identifiers

For each device, use the [Save Collection Instance](https://gateway.smallstep.com/v2023-11-01/operations/PutCollectionInstance) endpoint to create a device.
- For the `collectionSlug`, use `default`
- For Apple devices, the `instanceID` must be the device's serial number.
- For TPM 2.0 devices, the `instanceID` must be the TPM Endorsement Key URI, in the format `urn:ek:sha256:ul3sYf6uQ6jVEXAMPLEXoAuHI10U8gTvEJ6bMj95LXI=`. (You can retrieve the EK URI by running `step agent tpm --fingerprint` on the device.)

For the body of the request,
create a user using the following value 
(replacing `carl@smallstep.com` with the device owner's email address):

```
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Carl's MacBook Pro",
    "smallstep:identity": "carl@smallstep.com"
  }
}
```

Once added,
the devices will be automatically approved.

You can see the device using the [ListCollectionInstances](https://gateway.smallstep.com/v2023-11-01/operations/ListCollectionInstances) endpoint:

```bash
set +o history
echo "Authorization: Bearer [your token]" > api_headers
set -o history
curl -sH @api_headers https://gateway.smallstep.com/api/collections/default/items | jq
```

Or, in your Smallstep dashboard,
you'll see the device listed under Recent Devices.
