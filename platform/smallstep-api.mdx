description: The Smallstep platform is used across security, IT, and DevOps teams to enable end-to-end network encryption, privileged access management, passwordless authentication, and much more.

With the Smallstep API, you can:

- Register VMs with Smallstep as you spin them up, for instant trust bootstrapping
- Integrate certificate lifecycle management into your Terraform and Ansible definitions
- Programmatically manage CAs, SSH grants and tags, and more!

The Smallstep API is [OpenAPI conformant](https://www.openapis.org/), with JSON requests and responses.

### Smallstep API Setup and Usage

ðŸ‘‰ [Smallstep API Specification and Playground](https://gateway.smallstep.com)

You can get an API token in two ways:
- In your [Smallstep settings](https://smallstep.com/app?next=/settings). Under **API Tokens**, choose **+ Add Token.**
- On the command line, using the [`step` CLI](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/). The [`step api token create`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/api/token/create/index.html) command accepts a client certificate and private key to authenticate with Smallstep and issue a temporary API token. To use this option, you must first configure a trusted root CA in your [Smallstep settings](https://smallstep.com/app?next=/settings). The trusted root can be a Smallstep CA or an external CA. Only one trusted root CA may be configured.

### API Clients

- [Smallstep Terraform Provider](https://github.com/smallstep/terraform-provider-smallstep) ([Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/smallstep/smallstep/latest/docs))
- [Smallstep API Python Client](https://github.com/smallstep/smallstep-python)

### Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need an API token to get started. You can create one by [signing into the Smallstep dashboard](https://smallstep.com/app/). In the bottom-left **â‹®** menu, go to **Settings**. Under **API Tokens**, choose **+ Add Token.**

Your API token has a 10 year validity period and will only be displayed once. Please store it in a safe place!

Once you have a token, try your first API call:

```bash
set +o history
echo "Authorization: Bearer [your token]" > api_headers
set -o history
curl -sH @api_headers https://gateway.smallstep.com/api/users | jq
```

Output:

```bash
[
  {
    "active": true,
    "displayName": "Alice T",
    "emails": [
      {
        "email": "alice@smallstep.com",
        "primary": true
      }
    ],

]
```

### Configure Devices and Workloads via the API

Hereâ€™s the most common workflow for using the Smallstepi API, either directly or via the Terraform or Ansible integrations:

#### 1. [Create a device collection](https://gateway.smallstep.com/operations/PutDeviceCollection).
    
Set the device type according to your deployment. Note that each device type is going to have its own `deviceTypeConfiguration` as well. For example, an Azure VM device will require you to set your Azure tenant ID, for access control.
    
Youâ€™ll register your individual devices in step 3.
    
#### 2. [Add workloads](https://gateway.smallstep.com/operations/PutWorkload).
    
This is where you set up your workload configuration. You can specify things like certificate SANs and duration, certificate and key file ownership and permissions, reload options for the workload, and so on.

A single workload can be associated with multiple devices.

Have three HAProxy hosts in front of a fleet of `internal.example.com` web servers? Thatâ€™s one workload.

Have a PostgreSQL server with several hot standby servers? Thatâ€™s one workload.

Have an etcd cluster comprised of three hosts? Thatâ€™s one workload.

On this endpoint, you can use the `deviceMetadataKeySANs` property to dynamically map certificate SANs for each device thatâ€™s running a workload. Or, statically assign SANs for every certificate in the workload, using `staticSANs`.
    
#### 3. [Add devices to collection](https://gateway.smallstep.com/operations/PutCollectionInstance).
     
Each deviceâ€™s `instanceID` should be set according to the device type:
 
- For AWS EC2 instances, use the EC2 instance ID (eg. [`i-0d460b88a96dfdd08`](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-2#InstanceDetails:instanceId=i-0d460b88a96dfdd08))
- For Azure VMs, use the managed identity principal object ID
- For Compute Engine VMs, use the instance ID (eg. `16979701088048819`)
 
Use the `data` field to store any relevant instance metadata, such as:
 
- an instanceâ€™s region, name, or role(s)
- DNS names (these can be mapped to a SANs using `deviceMetadataKeySANs`, above)

#### 4. Install the Smallstep app on each device.
    
See [Smallstep App](./smallstep-app.mdx) for details.
