Smallstep SSH is a commercial product that delivers a complete end-to-end SSH
workflow combining the benefits of modern identity providers, SSH certificates,
and proven standard technologies like OpenSSH and OAuth. The Professional
Edition is a managed offering that takes the open source `step-ca` and adds
automatic access control, end-to-end user lifecycle management, event activity
logging, and reporting.
