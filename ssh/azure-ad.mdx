### Prerequisites

You will need:

* An account on the smallstep platform. Need one? [Register here](https://smallstep.com/signup?product=ssh)
* An Azure Premium edition account (P1 or higher)
* Global administrator access to the account

### Features

The following provisioning features are supported:

* Push Groups and New Users
* Push Profile or Group Updates
* Push User Deactivation
* Reactivate Users

## Overview
1. Create Groups in Microsoft Entra ID
2. Tell us your directory's Tenant ID
3. Add the Smallstep SSH Azure Enterprise Application to your tenant
4. Enable user provisioning (SCIM) in Azure
5. Check logs to confirm users and groups are syncing to Smallstep SSH

## Step By Step Instructions

### Step 1. Create Groups

You'll grant access to your hosts via Active Directory Groups. If you don't already have groups set up, you'll want to create a group for each kind of user access to your servers. For example, you might have a group for `ssh` users, and one for `sudo` users.

In the Azure portal, start at the [Groups](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GroupsManagementMenuBlade/AllGroups) blade.

When creating your groups, give them names and accept the defaults on all other settings.

### Step 2. Tell us your directory's Tenant ID

1. In the Smallstep SSH dashboard, under the Users tab, choose Azure.
2. Paste your Tenant ID from the [Active Directory Overview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) blade into the "Add Your Team" dialog:

3. Choose **Save**.

### Step 3. Add the Smallstep SSH Azure Enterprise Application

#### Sign in to Smallstep SSH

1.  Sign in to Smallstep at `https://smallstep.com/app/[Team ID]`
2.  Follow the Getting Started workflow.
3.  Choose the **Users** tab, and choose **Microsoft Entra ID** as your identity provider.
4.  Enter your **Tenant ID** and **Whitelisted Domains**, and **Save**.
5.  Now run `step ssh login your@email`.
    Your browser will open to an Entra ID single sign-on flow,
    and you'll be prompted to add the Smallstep SSH enterprise application to your tenant.

6.  Choose **Consent on behalf of your organization.**
7.  Accept the application for your tenant, and finish the sign-on flow.

> 🤦‍♂️ If you encounter "The username may be incorrect", you'll need to use a different account to accept the application into your tenant.
> Specifically, you cannot use a Microsoft Account or a Guest account; the account must be an Entra ID account.

#### Assign groups to your application

In the Azure Portal [Enterprise Applications](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps/menuId/) blade, you should now see Smallstep SSH. Open it.

Choose **Users and Groups** on the left:

1.  Go to **+ Add User** to create a new assignment.
2.  Select the groups you created in Step 1.
3.  Choose **Select** on the bottom right.
4.  Choose **Assign** on the bottom left.

Your Users and Groups list should now look something like this:

### Step 4. Enable user provisioning (SCIM) in Azure

1.  Choose **Provisioning** on the left and choose **Get Started**.
2.  Set the provisioning mode to **Automatic**.
4.  Expand **Admin Credentials:**
    * Supply the SCIM **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** from the Smallstep dashboard.
    * Choose **Test Connection** and make sure that it works.
	* Save.

> **Alternative `userName` Attribute Mappings**
>
> The `userName` attribute determines the name of the POSIX account that will be created when users connect to a host.
> By default, the expression returns the everything before the `@` in the UPN, converted to lowercase:
>
> ```
> ToLower(Replace([userPrincipalName], , "(?<Suffix>@(.)*)", "Suffix", "", , ), )
> ```
> Here are some alternative UPN expressions that have been useful to customers:
>
> - Remove dots `.` from usernames
>
>   Some users have dotted UPNs, and POSIX usernames _without_ dots.
>   Linux usernames with `.` in them are POSIX-compliant ([IEEE Std 1003.1-2017, section 3.437](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_437))
>   and in practice dotted usernames work fine on many systems.
>   If your UPNs contain dots,
>   you can configure the `userName` attribute mapping to remove them.
>   Use the following expression for your `userName` attribute:
> 
>   ``` 
>   ToLower(Replace(Replace([userPrincipalName], , "(?<Suffix>@(.)*)", "Suffix", "", , ), ".", , ,"", , ))
>   ```
>
> - Convert `bill.gates@microsoft.com` to `bgates`: 
>
>  ```
>  ToLower(Replace(Replace([userPrincipalName], , "(?<=^.{1}).\w+.\.", "", "", , ), , "(@(.)*)","","" , ,))
>  ```

##### Turn on Provisioning

1.  Save your settings and return to the **Provisioning** panel.
2.  Choose **Start Provisioning**.

> 🤦‍♂️ There's a quirk in Microsoft's UI here, and you may see an error when saving after turning provisioning on. If so, wait 60 seconds and try Save again.

### Step 5. Confirm the directory connection

Return to the Smallstep dashboard.

* Navigate to the LOGS menu. You should see a list of success messages assocated with `SCIM-SYNC` catagory items.

   ![](/graphics/quickstart/scim-logs.png "SCIM Logs")

* Navigate to the USERS menu. If the onboarding dialog is open, press `Esc` to close.
* You should see your Users and Groups synced over from Entra ID.

> **Don't see your users and groups?** Microsoft's SCIM service may add a 40-minute delay after you set it up. You can force an update by clicking **Restart provisioning** in the Provisioning panel. Even then, it may take a minute to sync with Smallstep.

### Entra ID Configuration Complete

## Troubleshooting Tips

* Initial activation of Entra ID OIDC provisioning in Smallstep SSH requires entering your **Application (client) ID**, **Client secret**, and **Configuration Endpoint** into the Smallstep UI. Contact smallstep support with any questions | [support@smallstep.com](mailto:support@smallstep.com)
* Note: When users are deactivated in Entra ID, they will be deactivated in Smallstep. Users will not be able to SSH to servers, but their user accounts will remain on smallstep managed hosts. To permanently delete user data on smallstep managed hosts, contact Smallstep Support | [support@smallstep.com](mailto:support@smallstep.com)
