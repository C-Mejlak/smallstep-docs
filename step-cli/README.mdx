## Introduction to `step`

`step` is an easy-to-use CLI tool for building, operating, and automating Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems and workflows. `step` acts as front-end interface to [Certificate Manager](../certificate-manager) and [`step-ca`](../step-ca), an online X.509 and SSH Certificate Authority (CA). `step` is also a standalone, general-purpose PKI toolkit: You can use it for many common crypto and X.509 operations.

## Using `step` with `step-ca`

If you'd like to use `step` with `step-ca`, head over to the [`step-ca` documentation](../step-ca) for command usage information and examples.

## Examples that don't require `step-ca`

`step` has plenty of features that make crypto easier for the casual user.

Here's a few common uses of the `step` command that don't require `step-ca`:

- [Create and work with X.509 certificates](./basic-crypto-operations.mdx#create-and-work-with-x509-certificates)
- [Get a TLS Certificate From Let's Encrypt](./basic-crypto-operations.mdx#get-a-tls-certificate-from-lets-encrypt)
- [Generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and JSON Web Keys (JWKs)](./basic-crypto-operations.mdx#generate-json-web-tokens-jwts-and-json-web-keys-jwks)
- [Obtain and Work With OAuth Tokens](./basic-crypto-operations.mdx#obtain-and-work-with-oauth-tokens)
- [Inspect an SSH certificate](./basic-crypto-operations.mdx#work-with-ssh-certificates)
- [Sign and encrypt arbitrary data using the NaCl library](./basic-crypto-operations.mdx#sign-and-encrypt-arbitrary-data)
- [Generate and verify TOTP tokens for multi-factor authentication (MFA)](./basic-crypto-operations.mdx#generate-totp-tokens-for-multi-factor-authentication-mfa)
- Add and remove CA certificates from your system's default trust store
