## Getting Help

`step` ships with extensive built-in help. To list available options and command groups, run `step` by itself. For help, use `step help <command>` or `step help <command> <subcommand>`.

## Environment variables
- `STEPPATH` The path where `step` stores configuration and state. This directory also holds `step-ca` state created with [`step ca init`](./reference/ca/init), including CA configuration, keys, certificates, and templates. Defaults to `$HOME/.step`.
- `STEPDEBUG` When set to `1`, `step` will provide extra diagnostic information for debugging. This variable can also be used with `step-ca`.
- `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` Configure proxies for outbound HTTPS traffic. See [net/http.ProxyFromEnvironment](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment) documentation for details. Note that the system trust store is _not_ trusted by `step` for the TLS handshake with the proxy server.
  - The proxy server will need to be configured to trust the CA.
  - Only `HTTPS_PROXY` is needed; `step`'s outbound connections are all HTTPS.
  - Add a `--root` or `STEP_ROOT` These files contain both the step CA certificate, and the proxy CA certificate will be trusted by step.

### Passing flags as environment variables

You can pass flags to `step` using environment variables, using `STEP_<flag>`. For example, `STEP_RAW=true step ssh list` is equivalent to `step ssh list --raw`. Command flags have precedence over environment variable flags, which in turn have precedence over the values in the [configuration file](#configuration-file).

## Configuration file

The file `$(step path)/config/defaults.json` can contain a JSON object listing default values for any flags accepted by `step` commands. It is typically used to store CA connection information, eg:

```json
{
  "ca-url": "https://ca.internal:8443",
  "fingerprint": "93cff06dc36251fb0c4985d0b5ed7265a368cd70697fba90355c93cc4aabff0d",
  "root": "/Users/carl/.step/certs/root_ca.crt",
  "redirect-url": ""
}
```

<Alert severity="info">
    It is not currently possible to segment default keys in <Code>defaults.json</Code> by subcommand. All keys are applied to all <Code>step</Code> commands.
</Alert>

## Contexts: Working with multiple CAs

By default, the `step` toolchain assumes a single CA is in use, and it will store client configuration, CA configuration, and state directories (`config`, `certs`, `secrets`, `db`, etc.) inside a single folder, `$HOME/.step`.

If you regularly work with multiple CAs, we recommend enabling _contexts_.

Contexts let you configure and select multiple CAs and configuration profiles.
If this optional feature is enabled, the `$HOME/.step` folder will have a different layout.

Every context consists of a client configuration profile (including [`defaults.json`](#configuration-file)),
and a directory tree for CA configuration and state data (`ca.json`, CA roots, certificates, secrets, templates, db).

To enable contexts,
pass the `--context` flag to any of the `step` setup commands, along with a label for your new context:

```bash
$ step ca bootstrap \
       --ca-url https://ca.internal:4443 \
	   --fingerprint c8d3...7aa \
	   --context vpn
The root certificate has been saved in /home/carl/.step/authorities/ca.internal/certs/root_ca.crt.
The authority configuration has been saved in /home/carl/.step/authorities/ca.internal/config/defaults.json.
The profile configuration has been saved in /home/carl/.step/profiles/ca.internal/config/defaults.json.
$ step context current
vpn
$ step path
/home/carl/.step/authorities/ca.internal
```

Contexts are enabled, and a new context is created, if `--context [name]` is passed to any of the following:
- CA client bootstrap: [`step ca bootstrap`](./reference/ca/bootstrap)
- CA server init: [`step ca init`](./reference/ca/init)
- CA server startup: `step-ca`
- SSH client bootstrap: [`step ssh config`](./reference/ssh/config)

When contexts are enabled:
- Client configuration is stored in the `profiles` directory, and CA server configuration and data is stored in `authorities` directory.
- Context configuration files `contexts.json` and `current-context.json` are created in the top-level `$STEPPATH`.
- There is always a currently active context ([`step context current`](./reference/context/current)), but you can pass a `--context` name to any [`step ca`](./reference/ca), [`step ssh`](./reference/ssh/), or `step-ca` command to temporarily select a context for a single operation.
- Use the [`step context`](./reference/context/) command group to switch contexts, remove a context and its associated configuration, and view the current context.
- The [`step path`](./reference/path/) command will show the current context's path. To display the top-level configuration directory name (`$STEPPATH`) when contexts are enabled, use `step path --base`.
- Two [`defaults.json`](#configuration-file) files are created: One in the `profiles` tree, and one in the `authorities` tree. They are merged, and the one in `profiles` takes precedence.
- Context configuration files `contexts.json` and `current-context.json` are created in the top-level `$STEPPATH`.

### Migrating to Contexts

There is no support for automatically migrating a single-profile `$STEPPATH` configuration into its own context.
Enabling contexts will preserve any previously existing configuration or state data in `$STEPPATH`,
but it will not migrate your existing configuration tree into its own new context.

## Extending `step`

The `step` command supports plugins for adding subcommands.
A plugin is an executable file called `step-COMMANDNAME-plugin` located in `$PATH` or `$STEPPATH/plugins`.
For example, a plugin named `$STEPPATH/plugins/step-dns-plugin` will execute when `step dns` is run.
If you're writing a plugin, please follow our convention for CLI help by implementing eg. `step dns help`.
