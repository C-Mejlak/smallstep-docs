title: Open Source PKI Tutorials
html_title: PKI tutorials use open source to learn by doing
description:
  Learn how to set up open source private PKI to issue certificates using ACME
  or cloud APIs. Issue X.509 certificates to humans using your identity
  provider.
---

`step-ca` is an online Certificate Authority (CA) for secure, automated X.509
and SSH certificate management. People use our tooling to automate issuance,
renewal, and revocation of certificates for all types of workloads and use
cases. This tutorial section highlights many popular deployment scenarios and is
designed to help the participant learn by doing. Each activity includes detailed
examples and copy/paste code blocks.

In general, these tutorials assume you have initialized and started up a
`step-ca` instance using the steps in
[Getting Started](../step-ca/getting-started.mdx). As an alternative, you can use
our hosted CA, [Smallstep Certificate Manager](https://smallstep.com/certificate-manager).
