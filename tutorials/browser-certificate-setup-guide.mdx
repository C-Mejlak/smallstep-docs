description: This tutorial describes how to set up web browsers to access resources using mutual TLS and Smallstep certificates.
---

## Before we begin

Certificate-based authentication in web browsers
offers excellent security characteristics, thanks to mutual TLS.
However, the user experience has traditionally been poor,
with mysterious certificate errors,
confusing certificate selector dialogs,
and differing behaviors between browsers.

Smallstep addresses these issues
by keeping certificates renewed,
offering simple remediation flows when an error occurs,
and ensuring that web browers are configured to find client certificates automatically,
so the user can have a seamless experience.

Smallstep browser certificates are available for macOS, Windows, and Linux endpoints.

To prepare an endpoint to use browser client certificates from Smallstep:
1. The endpoint should be [added to Smallstep](https://smallstep.com/docs/platform/enrollment-guide/).
2. A protected resource that uses browser certificates should be added to Smallstep. This could be a Browser resource, or the Smallstep Device IdP integration (eg. Smallstep for Okta).

## macOS

For this tutorial, we'll assume you're using Jamf Pro as your MDM.
The steps are very similar for other MDMs, however.

### Firefox

A [configuration profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-macos-using-configuration-prof) can be used to set Firefox's certificate preferences
so that the Smallstep certificate is automatically selected
when a protected resource is accessed.

1. In Jamf, navigate to **Computers > Configuration Profiles**
2. Create a new Configuration Profile and find the **Application & Custom Settings** > **Upload** page.
3. For Preference Domain, specify `org.mozilla.firefox`.
4. Create a plist file called `org.mozilla.firefox.plist`, and populate it with the following:

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
       <key>EnterprisePoliciesEnabled</key>
       <true/>
       <key>PayloadDisplayName</key>
       <string>Firefox ESR Policies</string>
       <key>PayloadEnabled</key>
       <true/>
       <key>PayloadIdentifier</key>
       <string>org.mozilla.firefox.BCADDC78-843E-4112-936A-DAB8EEEF514C</string>
       <key>PayloadType</key>
       <string>org.mozilla.firefox</string>
       <key>PayloadUUID</key>
       <string>BCADDC78-843E-4112-936A-DAB8EEEF514C</string>
       <key>PayloadVersion</key>
       <integer>1</integer>
       <key>Preferences</key>
       <dict>
         <key>security.default_personal_cert</key>
         <string>Select Automatically</string>
         <key>security.osclientcerts.autoload</key>
         <true/>
       </dict>
     </dict>
   </plist>
   ```
5. Upload the plist file to Jamf.
6. Deploy the configuration profile to your test endpoint.

To test the certificate, restart Firefox and visit `https://accounts.ca.[team-id].smallstep.com/-/hello-mtls`. You can find your Team ID in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

### Chrome

A [configuration profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9020077?hl=en) can be used to set Chrome's certificate preferences
so that the Smallstep certificate is automatically selected
when a protected resource is accessed.

1. In Jamf, navigate to **Computers > Configuration Profiles**
2. Create a new Configuration Profile and find the **Application & Custom Settings** > **Upload** page.
3. For Preference Domain, specify `com.google.Chrome`.
4. Create a plist file called `com.google.Chrome.plist`, and populate it with the following:

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
       <key>AutoSelectCertificateForUrls</key>
       <array>
         <dict>
           <key>pattern</key>
           <string>[Server URL]</string>
           <key>filter</key>
           <dict>
              <key>ISSUER</key>
              <dict>
                <key>CN</key>
                <string>Smallstep Accounts Intermediate CA</string>
              </dict>
           </dict>
         </dict>
       </array>
     </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

   Replace `[Server URL]` with the server that requires certificate authentication.
   This field is an [Enterprise policy URL pattern](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/url-patterns/).

   Note: According to [Understand Chrome policy management](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9037717),
   Chrome will *not* merge multiple `AutoSelectCertificateForUrls` policies.
   You must add all of your certificate selection preferences into a single managed configuration profile.

5. Upload the plist file to Jamf.
6. Deploy the configuration profile to your test endpoint.

To test the certificate, restart Firefox and visit `https://accounts.ca.[team-id].smallstep.com/-/hello-mtls`. You can find your Team ID in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

### Safari

Safari relies on the Keychain and system-level certificate trust settings, rather than per-app policies like Chrome and Firefox. Certificate selection in Safari is mostly automatic, but it may prompt the user if multiple matching client certificates exist. Smallstep's agent will set identity preferences as needed.
