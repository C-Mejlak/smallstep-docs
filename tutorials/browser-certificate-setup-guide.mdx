description: This tutorial describes how to set up web browsers to access resources using mutual TLS and Smallstep certificates.
---

## Before we begin

Certificate-based authentication in web browsers
offers excellent security characteristics, thanks to mutual TLS.

However, the user experience has traditionally been poor,
with mysterious certificate errors,
confusing certificate authentication dialogs,
and differing behaviors between browsers.

Smallstep addresses these issues
by keeping certificates renewed,
offering simple remediation flows when an error occurs,
and ensuring that web browers are configured to find client certificates automatically,
so the user can have a seamless experience.

Smallstep browser certificates are available for macOS, Windows, and Linux devices.

Before you begin, make sure:

1. Your devices are [added to Smallstep](https://smallstep.com/docs/platform/enrollment-guide/).
2. Someone from [our support team](https://support.smallstep.com/kb-tickets/new) has helped you get set up. Your Smallstep team is configured properly for the resource that you are trying to protect.

## macOS

For this tutorial, we'll assume you're using Jamf Pro as your MDM.
The steps are very similar for other MDMs, however.

### Firefox

#### Authority configuration

Firefox has its own trust store for CAs.

To install the root CA certificate, run:

```
step certificate install root_ca.crt --firefox
```

To confirm root CA trust, restart Firefox and visit <a href="about:certificate">about:certificate</a>. Navigate to the Authorities tab. `Smallstep Accounts Intermediate CA` should be listed.

#### Client certificate auto-selection

A [configuration profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-macos-using-configuration-prof) can be used to set Firefox's certificate preferences
so that the Smallstep certificate is automatically selected
when a protected resource is accessed.

1. In Jamf, navigate to **Computers > Configuration Profiles**
2. Create a new Configuration Profile and find the **Application & Custom Settings** > **Upload** page.
3. For Preference Domain, specify `org.mozilla.firefox`.
4. Create a plist file called `org.mozilla.firefox.plist`, and populate it with the following:

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
       <key>EnterprisePoliciesEnabled</key>
       <true/>
       <key>PayloadDisplayName</key>
       <string>Firefox ESR Policies</string>
       <key>PayloadEnabled</key>
       <true/>
       <key>PayloadIdentifier</key>
       <string>org.mozilla.firefox.BCADDC78-843E-4112-936A-DAB8EEEF514C</string>
       <key>PayloadType</key>
       <string>org.mozilla.firefox</string>
       <key>PayloadUUID</key>
       <string>BCADDC78-843E-4112-936A-DAB8EEEF514C</string>
       <key>PayloadVersion</key>
       <integer>1</integer>
       <key>Preferences</key>
       <dict>
         <key>security.default_personal_cert</key>
         <string>Select Automatically</string>
         <key>security.osclientcerts.autoload</key>
         <true/>
       </dict>
     </dict>
   </plist>
   ```
5. Upload the plist file to Jamf.
6. Deploy the configuration profile to your test device.

To test the certificate, visit `https://accounts.ca.[team-id].smallstep.com/-/hello-mtls`. You can find your Team ID in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

### Chrome

#### Authority configuration


#### Client certificate auto-selection

A [configuration profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9020077?hl=en) can be used to set Chrome's certificate preferences
so that the Smallstep certificate is automatically selected
when a protected resource is accessed.

1. In Jamf, navigate to **Computers > Configuration Profiles**
2. Create a new Configuration Profile and find the **Application & Custom Settings** > **Upload** page.
3. For Preference Domain, specify `com.google.Chrome`.
4. Create a plist file called `com.google.Chrome.plist`, and populate it with the following:

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
       <key>AutoSelectCertificateForUrls</key>
       <array>
         <dict>
           <key>pattern</key>
           <string>[Server URL]</string>
           <key>filter</key>
           <dict>
              <key>ISSUER</key>
              <dict>
                <key>CN</key>
                <string>Smallstep Accounts Intermediate CA</string>
              </dict>
           </dict>
         </dict>
       </array>
     </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

   Replace `[Server URL]` with the server that requires certificate authentication.
   This field is an [Enterprise policy URL pattern](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/url-patterns/).

   Note: According to [Understand Chrome policy management](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9037717),
   Chrome will *not* merge multiple `AutoSelectCertificateForUrls` policies.
   You must add all of your certificate selection preferences into a single managed configuration profile.

5. Upload the plist file to Jamf.
6. Deploy the configuration profile to a test device.
7. On the device, restart Chrome and visit the [policies tab](chrome://policy/) to verify the applied policy.

To test the certificate, visit `https://accounts.ca.[team-id].smallstep.com/-/hello-mtls`. You can find your Team ID in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

### Safari

#### Authority configuration

Safari will trust CA certificates in Keychain Access, as long as their trust setting for SSL is turned on.
The easiest way to deploy a trusted CA to a fleet of Apple devices is via MDM.

#### Client certificate auto-selection

Safari relies on the Keychain and system-level certificate trust settings, rather than per-app policies like Chrome and Firefox. Certificate selection in Safari is mostly automatic, but it may prompt the user if multiple matching client certificates exist. Smallstep's agent will set identity preferences as needed.

To test the certificate, visit `https://accounts.ca.[team-id].smallstep.com/-/hello-mtls`. You can find your Team ID in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

## Windows

### Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome

#### Client certificate auto-selection

1. Confirm that a client certificate has been issued, run `certmgr` from PowerShell.
   Look inside Certificates - Current User → Personal → Certificates.
   You should see a certificate issued by `Smallstep Accounts Intermediate CA`.

2. In Chrome, confirm that your certificate is visible in <a href="chrome://settings/certificates">chrome://settings/certificates</a>. If not, restart Chrome.

For Chrome and Edge, we can use the [`AutoSelectCertificateForUrls`](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/?policy=AutoSelectCertificateForUrls) policy to prevent the certificate selection dialog from appearing.

1. Open the Registry Editor (`regedit`)
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome` for Chrome, or `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge` for Edge. If the key you're looking for doesn't exist, you may need to create the `Google` and `Google/Chrome` keys or the `Edge` key.
3. In the registry path for your browser, create a new String Value named `AutoSelectCertificateForUrls`
4. Set the value to `["{\"pattern\":\"$URL\",\"filter\":{\"ISSUER\":{\"CN\":\"Smallstep Accounts Intermediate CA\"}}}"]`, substituting `$URL` for the URL you want to use with the Smallstep client certificate.
5. Restart the browser. In Chrome, visit <a href="chrome://policies">chrome://policies</a> to confirm the policy change.
6. Visit the URL you want to use the client certificate for. Your certificate should be selected automatically.

## Linux

### Google Chrome

#### Authority configuration

Since Chrome trusts the Linux system trust store, we need to install the root CA certificate there.

1. Install your root CA certificate to the trusted location:


   ```
   sudo step certificate install your-root-ca.crt
   ```

2. Restart your web browser

#### Client certificate auto-selection

We can use the [AutoSelectCertificateForUrls](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/?policy=AutoSelectCertificateForUrls) Chrome policy to automatically select the client certificate without presenting a dialog:
1. As root, create a policy file: `/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/auto_select_cert.json` 
2. Add the following content:

   ```
   {
       "AutoSelectCertificateForUrls": ["{\"pattern\":${url},\"filter\":{\"ISSUER\":{\"CN\":\"Smallstep Accounts Intermediate CA\"}}}"]
   }
   ```

   Replace `${url}` with the server that requires certificate authentication.
   For example:
   
   ```json
   {
       "AutoSelectCertificateForUrls": ["{\"pattern\":\"https://example.id.smallstep.com\",\"filter\":{\"ISSUER\":{\"CN\":\"Smallstep Accounts Intermediate CA\"}}}"]
   }
   ```

3. Restart Chrome, and visit the [policies tab](chrome://policy/) to verify the applied policy.

Finally, let's verify that the user has a client certificate from the Smallstep agent.
1. Run `certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -L`. You should see `Smallstep Accounts Intermediate CA` in the list.
2. Restart Chrome, and verify that the client certificate is in <a href="chrome://settings/certificates">Chrome's Certificate Manager</a>
Don't see it? Check that the Smallstep agent is installed correctly.

To test the certificate, visit `https://accounts.ca.[team-id].smallstep.com/-/hello-mtls`. You can find your Team ID in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

### Firefox

#### Authority configuration

Firefox has its own trust store for CAs.

To install the root CA certificate, run:

```
step certificate install root_ca.crt --firefox
```

To confirm root CA trust, restart Firefox and visit <a href="about:certificate">about:certificate</a>. Navigate to the Authorities tab. `Smallstep Accounts Intermediate CA` should be listed there.

#### Client certificate auto-selection

Use the <a href="about:certificate">about:certificate</a> URL to see all of the client certificates installed in Firefox's certificate database.

To test the certificate, visit `https://accounts.[team-id].ca.smallstep.com/-/hello-mtls`. You can find your Team ID in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).
