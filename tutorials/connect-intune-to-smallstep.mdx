description: Configure Intune to deploy the Smallstep Agent and distribute certificates and configuration to Mac clients.
---

Smallstep can integrate with Microsoft Intune to synchronize your device inventory, to excahnge SCEP tokens, and to enroll your fleet with Smallstep using the Smallstep Agent. A SCEP token is a single-use password that's used by devices to get a certificate from Smallstep for bootstrapping.

In this document, we will configure your Microsoft Intune instance for use with your Smallstep team and any Windows endpoints.

To configure the connection, let‚Äôs first set up an Application in Entra ID. Then, we‚Äôll add the client credentials to Smallstep.

# Prerequisites

You will need:

- A [Smallstep team](https://smallstep.com/signup)
- A [Microsoft Azure / Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=azurefreeaccount) Tenant. A Global Administrator role is required to grant tenant-wide API consent.
- A [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-intune) Tenant. An Intune Administrator role is required.
- A test device to enroll for management. This can be a Windows VM, but you may need a physical device or additional Wi-Fi adapter if you are testing an Enterprise Wi-Fi connection.

Client requirements:

- The agent will need to reach the following domains:
  ```
  smallstep.com
  api.smallstep.com
  gateway.smallstep.com
  control.infra.smallstep.com
  *.[team-name].ca.smallstep.com
  auth.smallstep.com
  att.smallstep.com
  ```
- Windows 10 (Anniversary Edition) or higher is supported. Windows Home is not supported.

# Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Register an Entra ID Application

You‚Äôll need to register an Application in Entra ID that connects Smallstep to Intune. 

In the Entra Admin Center, [Register an Application](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/CreateApplicationBlade/quickStartType~/null/isMSAApp~/false) with the following properties:

- Name the application ‚ÄúSmallstep‚Äù
- Leave all other values alone
- Select **Register**

Find your new App Registration, and copy the **Application (client) ID** value, which you will register with Smallstep later.

Next, visit the **Certificates & secrets** blade.

Select **Ôºã New client secret**, and use the following properties:

- Name the secret ‚ÄúSmallstep Secret‚Äù
- Choose a validity period that matches your security policies. When you rotate the client secret, you will need to update it in your Smallstep settings.
- Select **Add** to create the secret

Copy the **Client Secret Value**, which you will register with Smallstep later.

### 2. Grant API Permissions

Now we‚Äôll connect the App Registration to Intune by adding application permissions.

In the App Registration, visit the **API Permissions** blade.

First, add the following permissions:

- Microsoft Graph ‚Üí Application permissions ‚Üí `Application.Read.All`
- Microsoft Graph ‚Üí Application permissions ‚Üí `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`
- Intune ‚Üí Application permissions ‚Üí `scep_challenge_provider`
- Intune ‚Üí Application permissions ‚Üí `get_data_warehouse`

Next, select **‚úì Grant admin consent** on the API permissions page, and confirm.

Here‚Äôs how the Configured permissions should look:

You‚Äôve completed the App Registration setup.

### 3. Configure Smallstep

In Smallstep, navigate to [Settings ‚Üí Device Management](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/devices).

Configure the Integration with the values you gathered above:

- The Entra ID tenant **Primary domain**, from your [Entra ID Tenant Overview](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/TenantOverview.ReactView) (eg. `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`)
- The App Registration **Application (client) ID**
- The App Registration **Secret Value**

Within a few minutes, you will see all of your Intune devices in the [Devices](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/devices/all) tab. Your Smallstep device inventory is synced approximately every four hours.

### 4. Add the Smallstep Agent for app distribution

In this step, we‚Äôll add the Smallstep Agent to Intune for distribution to devices.

1. In Intune,
    1. Start at [Windows Apps](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/AppsWindowsMenu/~/windowsApps)
    2. Choose **+ Create,** and then select **Line-of-business app**
    3. [Download the Smallstep agent `.msi.` package](https://github.com/smallstep/step-agent-plugin/releases/latest) and select it for upload in Intune. Both `amd64` and `arm64` installers are available.
    - For the App Information tab:
        - Under Publisher, use ‚ÄúSmallstep‚Äù
        - Choose ‚ÄúNext‚Äù
    - For the Assignments tab:
        - Assign the app to devices as desired.
    - On ‚ÄúReview and Create‚Äù click **Create**

### 5. Configure Agent Enrollment Policy Set

In this step, we‚Äôll tie everything together by creating Windows policy to enroll devices using the Smallstep Agent.

Your Smallstep team is now linked to Intune. The devices that you scoped will receive a certificate and have the agent installed and running.

### Confirmation

There's two ways to confirm installation on an endpoint:

- In the Smallstep UI, go to the device's profile page. In the **Device Registration** section, you'll see an **Enrolled At** timestamp.
- When viewing a Windows/Intune device in the Smallstep UI, you can review device logs to confirm connectivity to the platform and issued certificates.

### Uninstall Smallstep on Intune

In Intune, go to Apps and choose the Smallstep agent app.

Under the Assignments tab, remove all devices from Required and Available sections, and add all devices to the Uninstall section.
