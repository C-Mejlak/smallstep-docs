Smallstep can integrate with [Omnissa Workspace ONE UEM](https://www.omnissa.com/products/workspace-one-unified-endpoint-management/) to keep your device inventory in sync and to exchange SCEP tokens. A SCEP token is a single-use password that's used by devices to get a certificate from Smallstep.

To configure the connection, let’s first set up an Application in Entra ID. Then, we’ll add the client credentials to Smallstep.

# Prerequisites

You will need:

- A [Smallstep team](https://smallstep.com/signup)
- A [Workspace ONE UEM](https://www.omnissa.com/products/workspace-one-unified-endpoint-management/) tenant
- A test device to enroll for management
    - This can be a Windows VM, but you may need a physical device or additional Wi-Fi adapter for testing an Enterprise Wi-Fi connection. Windows Home edition is not supported.

# Step-by-step instructions

## Connect Smallstep to Workspace ONE via OAuth

First, we’ll create a scoped API role for Smallstep:

1. In Workspace ONE UEM, navigate to **Accounts → Admin Roles** and choose **+ Add Role**
2. Create a role named “Smallstep” with a description of “Smallstep Integration”
3. Smallstep needs Read access to Devices, using the REST API:
Choose API → REST on the left, and choose ✅ Read for the row “Devices”
    
    ![Workspace ONE API Panel](workspace-one/api-panel.png)
 
4. Choose **Save**

Next, we’ll create an OAuth client for Smallstep:

1. In Workspace ONE UEM, navigate to **Groups & Settings → Configurations** and find **OAuth Client Management** in the list.
2. Choose **Add** and add a new client with a name of “Smallstep” and description of “Smallstep MDM Integration for Device Sync”
3. For **Organization Group**, select the group most appropriate for managing your desired device inventory.
4. For **Role**, choose **Smallstep**
5. Choose **Save.**
6. Copy the resulting client ID and secret value.

### 2. Configure Smallstep OAuth settings

In Smallstep, navigate to [Settings → Device Management](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/devices).

Configure a new Omnissa Workspace ONE Integration with the values you gathered above:

- The Workspace ONE UEM REST API URL for your tenant.
    - This URL is shown in UEM’s settings. Navigate to
    
    **Groups and Settings** → **All Settings →** **System** → **Advanced** → **API** → **Rest API**
    
    and copy the REST API URL from that page.
    
- The Workspace ONE UEM [OAuth 2.0 Token URL for your region](https://docs.omnissa.com/bundle/WorkspaceONE-UEM-Console-BasicsVSaaS/page/UsingUEMFunctionalityWithRESTAPI.html#datacenter_and_token_urls_for_oauth_20_support)
- The OAuth client ID and secret you saved in Step 1

After saving the Workspace ONE connection, you will see settings for your integration. Copy the following details for later:

- SCEP URL
- SCEP Challenge URL
- Challenge Basic Authentication Username
- Challenge Basic Authentication Password

Within a few minutes after adding the connection, you should see all of your Workspace ONE devices in the [Devices](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/devices/all) tab. Device inventory is synced approximately every four hours.

### 3. Deploy and configure the Smallstep Agent

In this step, we’ll add the Smallstep Agent to Workspace One UEM for distribution to devices.

1. In Workspace One UEM,
    - Go to Resources → Native Apps.
    - Choose Add → Application File.
    - Download the [latest version](https://github.com/smallstep/step-agent-plugin/releases/latest) of `step-agent-plugin_amd64_<version>.msi` and select it for upload to UEM. Note the version number you downloaded—you’ll need it later.
    - Choose **Continue**
2. In the Add Application panel’s **Details tab**,
    - Set Supported Processor Architecture to `64-bit` (or `ARM64` if used)
    - For Minimum OS, select Windows 10 (10.0.15063)
3. In the Add Application panel’s **Deployment Options** tab,
    - Set Install Context to **Device**
4. FInally, choose **Save & Assign**

### For ARM64 devices

If you also are deploying to ARM-based devices, repeat these steps for the `arm64` MSI installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/smallstep/step-agent-plugin/releases/latest).

Workspace ONE will try to distribute *both* installers to both `arm64` and `amd64` devices. You’ll need to segregate your devices by OS and CPU Architecture. To do this, create two new Smart Groups in Groups & Settings → Assignment Groups—one for `arm64` devices, and one for `amd64` devices. Assign each application to the appropriate Smart Group.

The Application Distribution Assignment page appears next.

1. Give the Assignment a name
2. Choose the groups you’d like to assign the application to. Assign the app to a single devices or a small group of test devices for a staged rollout.
3. Select App Delivery Method: Auto
4. Create the Assignment.
5. Choose **Save**
6. Choose **Publish** to begin distributing the app.

### Create a script for Smallstep Agent configuration

1. In Workspace One UEM, visit **Resources → Scripts**
2. Choose **Add** and then **Windows**
    1. In the General tab, provide a name for the script, such as “Smallstep Agent Enrollment”
    2. On the Details tab, ensure the **Language** is “Poweshell” and the **Execution Context & Privileges** is “System Context”
    3. Use the following snippet as the **Code**, making sure to replace `<team-id>` with the Team ID value you copied from the Smallstep UI earlier.
        
        ```xml
        New-Item -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Smallstep"
        Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Smallstep" -Name "TeamSlug" -Value "<team-id>"
        Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Smallstep" -Name "Certificate" -Value "capi:store-location=machine;store=My;issuer=Smallstep (<team-id>) Agents Intermediate CA;cn=$env:DEVICE_ID"
        ```
        
    4. In the Variables tab, click **Add**. Set the variable **Key** to `DEVICE_ID` and the variable **Value** to `{DeviceUuId}` 

### 4. Configure Agent Enrollment Profiles

In this step, we’ll tie everything together by creating Windows policy to enroll devices using the Smallstep Agent.

### Gather required details

1. You’ll need the following values from when your configuration your Workspace ONE connection:
    - SCEP URL
    - SCEP Challenge URL
    - Challenge Basic Authentication Username
    - Challenge Basic Authentication Password
    
    If you need to retrieve these again, you can always visit: [**Settings → Device Management](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/devices) → Omnissa Workspace ONE**
    

### Add a Workspace ONE CA resource

For compatibility with Workspace ONE, Smallstep emulates the Microsoft ADCS’s Dynamic SCEP and NDES enrollment protocols.

1. In Workspace One UEM, visit **Resources → Certificate Authorities**
2. Choose **+ Add**
    1. Provide a name for the CA connection, e.g. Smallstep Agents CA
    2. For Authority Type, choose `Microsoft ADCS`

A new modal screen will be presented with the empty Request Template configuration

1. Provide a name for the Template, e.g. `Smallstep Agents`
2. For Certificate Authority, choose the Smallstep CA you just connected
3. For the subject name, use a value of `CN={DeviceUuid}`
4. For Private Key Length, use 2048
5. For Private Key Type, choose both Signing and Encryption
6. Add a new SAN Type of type URL, and set the value to `deviceid://{DeviceUuid}`
7. For Automatic Certificate Renewal, choose Enabled
    - Pick an appropriate Auto Renewal Period (5 days is common)
8. Ensure Publish Private Key is Disabled
9. Choose **Save**

### Creating a Windows Profile

        2. Other options can be left as-is
        3. Optionally, click the View Device Assignment button to see the devices to which the profile will be distributed
    6. Add a Credential by clicking the **Configure** button , and set the following settings:
        1. Credential Store: Defined Certificate Authority
        2. Certificate Authority: Choose the CA connection you created earlier
        3. The certificate template should be selected automatically. If not, select an appropriate one.
        4. Key Location: TPM Required
        5. Certificate Store: Personal
    7. Click Save and Publish to finalize the configuration of the profile.
    8. A modal screen will be shown with the devices to which the profile will be distributed. Click Publish if the assignment looks OK.

### Confirmation

There's two ways to confirm installation on an endpoint:

- In the Smallstep UI, go to the device's profile page. In the **Device Registration** section, you'll see an **Enrolled At** timestamp.
