# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will configure Smallstep and Microsoft Intune to establish device trust with your CA and to orchestrate the issuance of TLS certificates for Enterprise Wi-Fi (EAP-TLS / WPA3 Enterprise), VPN, web browsers, or other applications on Windows devices.

You will:

- Connect Microsoft Entra ID to Smallstep via an Entra ID App Registration.
- Configure an Intune Integration in Smallstep
- Configure Intune to use Smallstep as a CA

Once you've completed this tutorial, your Intune certificate enrollment process will look like this:

# Prerequisites

You will need:
- A [Smallstep team](https://smallstep.com/signup)
- A [Microsoft Azure / Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=azurefreeaccount) Tenant
- A [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-intune) Tenant
- A test device to enroll for management by Intune
    - This can be a Windows VM, but you may need a physical device or additional Wi-Fi adapter for testing an Enterprise Wi-Fi connection
- An Entra ID user for enrollment, that is known in Intune

# Step-by-step instructions

## 0. Gather Entra ID tenant details

In your [Entra ID Tenant Overview](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/TenantOverview.ReactView),  copy your tenant’s Primary Domain, eg. `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`. You will register this with Smallstep later.

## 1. Register an Entra ID Application

You’ll need to register an Application in Entra ID that connects Smallstep to Intune, for the purpose of exchanging SCEP tokens. A SCEP token is a single-use password that's used by devices to get a certificate from Smallstep.

In the Entra Admin Center, [Register an Application](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/CreateApplicationBlade/quickStartType~/null/isMSAApp~/false) with the following properties:

- Name the application “Smallstep SCEP Connector”
- Leave all other values alone
- Select **Register**

In your new App Registration, copy the **Application (client) ID** value, which you will register with Smallstep later.

Next, visit the **Certificates & secrets** blade.

Select **＋ New client secret**, and use the following properties:

- Name the secret “Smallstep SCEP Secret”
- Select **Add** to create the secret

Copy the **Client Secret Value**, which you will register with Smallstep later.


## 2. Grant API Permissions

Now we’ll connect the App Registration to Intune by adding application permissions.

In the App Registration, visit the **API Permissions** blade.

Add the following permissions:

- Microsoft Graph → Application permissions → `Application.Read.All`
- Microsoft Graph → Application permissions → `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`
- Intune → Application permissions → `scep_challenge_provider`
- Intune → Application permissions → `get_data_warehouse`

Finally, select **✓ Grant admin consent** on the API permissions page.

Here’s how the Configured permissions should look:

You’ve completed the App Registration setup.

## 3. Configure Smallstep

In your Smallstep dashboard,
visit the **Integrations** tab,
and choose **Intune**.

Configure the integration with the values you gathered above:

- The App Registration **Application (client) ID**
- The App Registration **Secret Value**
- The **Intune Tenant Name** (this is the tenant's primary domain)

Once the integration is added, go to the Protect tab.
Choose either Wi-Fi or VPN, depending on what you need, and add a Wi-Fi or VPN resource.
This tutorial assumes you are configuring EAP-TLS Wi-Fi network access.
Once you've created the Wi-Fi resource, open the Wi-Fi resource details page.
You can keep this tab open as you configure Intune.

To prepare for the next section:
- Download your Root CA Certificate
- Download your Intermediate CA Certificate
- Copy your SCEP URL

## 4. Configure Intune

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
[Microsoft recommends a staged approach to Intune enrollment](https://download.microsoft.com/download/e/6/2/e6233fdd-a956-4f77-93a5-1aa254ee2917/msft-intune-enrollment-options.pdf). Create an evaluation Group, if you don’t already have one, so that any breaking changes are limited to the  group.
  </div>
</Alert>

In Intune, we’re going to create three Configuration Profiles to deploy to your devices:

- **Trusted certificate** profile for your Root CA
- **Trusted certificate** profile for your Intermediate CA
- **SCEP Certificate** profile, for issuing device certificates from Smallstep

### Create a Trusted certificate profile for your Root CA

Create a [new Trusted certificate profile](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/CreatePolicyFullScreenBlade/policyId/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/policyType/Windows10TrustedCertificate/policyJourneyState~/0) with the following properties:

- Name: **Smallstep Root CA**
- Certificate file: Upload your Smallstep Root CA certificate
- Destination store: **Computer certificate store - root**
- Included groups: Include the users or groups you are using for your staged enrollment. As you roll out into production, you will expand this list.
- Create the profile

### Create a **Trusted certificate** profile for your Intermediate CA

Create a [new Trusted certificate profile](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/CreatePolicyFullScreenBlade/policyId/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/policyType/Windows10TrustedCertificate/policyJourneyState~/0) with the following properties:

- Name: **Smallstep Intermediate CA**
- Certificate file: Upload your Smallstep Intermediate CA certificate
- Destination store: **Computer certificate store - root**
  
  <Alert severity="warning">
    <div>
      **Careful!** Add your intermediate CA to the computer’s *root* store.
      Do not choose the intermediate certificate store — it will cause enrollment errors.
    </div>
  </Alert>
  
- Included groups: Include the users or groups you are using for testing.
- Create the profile

### Create a **SCEP Certificate** profile

Create [a new SCEP certificate profile](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/CreatePolicyFullScreenBlade/policyId/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/policyType/Windows10SCEP/policyJourneyState~/0) with the following properties:

- Name: **Smallstep SCEP Certificate**
- Certificate type: Device
- The certificate properties may vary depending on your use case and threat model. Here are some good starting points:
    - Subject name / SANs: For a test deployment, use the default values.
    - Certificate validity period: Use the same duration you configured with Smallstep
    - Key storage provider: **Enroll to TPM KSP if available, Software KSP if not**
    - Key usage: **✓ Digital certificate** and **✓ Key encipherment**
    - Key size: **2048**
    - Hash algorithm: **SHA-2**
    - Extended key usage: Under Predefined values, select **Client Authentication**
    - Renewal Threshold (%): Select **20%**
- Root Certificate: Select your **Intermediate CA**
    
  <Alert severity="warning">
    <div>
    **Careful!** Select your intermediate CA here. An enrolling device’s SCEP client will check the fingerprint of the intermediate, *not* the root.
    </div>
  </Alert>
    
- SCEP Server URL: Use the SCEP URL you copied from Smallstep

## 5. Test and verify your profile

Now try enrolling or syncing a device.

These instructions may vary depending on your enrollment method.
We assume you’ve enabled Automatic Enrollment in Intune’s [Windows enrollment blade](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesEnrollmentMenu/~/windowsEnrollment).

- For a new device: Go to **Windows Settings → Accounts → Access work or school**. Then , under **Add a work or school account**, choose **Connect** to sign in to your tenant.
- For a previously-enrolled device: Go to **Windows Settings → Accounts → Access work or school**. Expand the box for the signed-in account and select **Info**. Select **Sync**.

After the sync completes, it may take a minute for the certificate to appear in your Windows trust store.

Check the reports in Intune to ensure your devices have enrolled without errors.

# Adding Wi-Fi Support

Now that we have a basic working profile with CA trust and a client certificate, we’ll configure an EAP-TLS certificate Wi-Fi connection.

For this section, you will need a RADIUS server that your users will authenticate against.

1. In your Intune [Device Configuration Profiles](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/~/configurationProfiles), create a **+ New Policy**.
2. Choose your Platform, select **Templates**, and choose the **Wi-Fi** template.
3. Select **Create** to continue, and give your template a clear name.
4. For **Wi-Fi type**, choose Enterprise.
5. Configure your SSID and other basic network settings.
6. For **EAP type**, choose **EAP - TLS**.
7. Under the Certificate server names, enter the Common Name that's on your RADIUS server certificate.
   Typically, will match the FQDN of your RADIUS server.
8. Under the Trust tab, add a Trusted Certificate for your RADIUS server.

    If your RADIUS server certificate is managed by Smallstep, add the <a href="https://dl.smallstep.com/radius.smallstep.com-root.crt">Smallstep RADIUS Root CA PEM</a> here.

    If your RADIUS server certificate is from a different PKI, you’ll need to add a new Certificate payload containing your RADIUS server’s Root CA certificate.
9. Under **Client Authentication**, for **Authentication method** choose SCEP Certificate.
10. Select the client certificate profile you created earlier.
11. Choose **Review + save**.

Once you've saved your profile, you'll be ready to test and verify your Wi-Fi connection.

# Troubleshooting

- Check the expected certificates have been deployed to the right stores on Windows: user vs. device; trusted roots; trusted intermediates; personal certificates.
    - Intune does show states in the dashboard, and you can generate reports, but they don’t provide many details, and sometimes they’re not up-to-date.
- On the client side, use **Settings → Accounts → Access work or school → Info** to check the last sync status.
    - You can also trigger a Sync on this screen
    - Sometimes restarting Windows is required to trigger (re-)enrollment / profile deployment. This can happen if the machine has been online for a while, has been suspended for a while, etc. It may have been disconnected from WNS in this case, resulting in no notifications being received.
    - There’s an option to generate an MDM report with some basic information that describes which profiles are to be applied.
- Use Windows Event Viewer to diagnose issues. SCEP related (error) logs can be found in **Applications and Services Logs** → **Microsoft** → **Windows** → **DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider**.
