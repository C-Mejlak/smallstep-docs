This tutorial describes how to deploy and configure an Azure Virtual Network Gateway for certificate-based IPSec IKEv2 VPN authentication with Smallstep.
The Smallstep app can will configure and issue certificates to your clients.

## Introduction

You can use an [Azure Point-to-Site VPN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-about) to connect clients to your Azure virtual network.

In this tutorial, we'll set up client certificate authenticatin with Smallstep, using an IPSec IKEv2 VPN.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. Start by deploying a Virtual Network Gateway. Follow the steps in [Create the VPN Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal#creategw) section of Microsoft's tutorial. Deploy the gateway, but do not generate any certificates yet.

2. Once the Gateway is deployed, gather the following properties for your Virtual Network Gateway:

   * The gateway's **Public IP Address**
   * The gateway's **Remote ID** and **Root CA Certificate**.
     These are loacated inside the Point-to-Site configuration settings file.
     To find these values,
     in the Point-to-Site Configuration tab of the Virtual Network Gateway settings,
     choose **Download VPN Client**.

   When you choose "Download VPN Client", you will receive a ZIP file containing two crucial configuration parameters:
   
     * Your gateway's **Remote ID**, located in `Generic/VpnSettings.xml`.
       The Remote ID is the value inside the `<VpnServer>` XML tag.
       It will look like this:

       ```
       azuregateway-90fe1132-27af-6789-8aa9-4993ac57dd5b-7981e7988384.vpn.azure.com
       ```

     * Your gateway's **Root CA Certificate**, located in `Generic/VpnServerRoot.cer_0`
       
       This file is in DER (binary) certificate format.
       Before you upload it to Smallstep, convert it to PEM format.
       Run:
       
       ```
       step certificate format VpnServerRoot.cer_0 > VpnServerRoot.pem
       ```

3. In [Smallstep](https://smallstep.com/app), create a Mobile Device Collection and add your device to it.
   (If you're using the Smallstep app, a New Devices collection will be created for you when you sign in.)

4. Now, under the Accounts tab of your Device Collection, create a VPN Account:

   * Connection type: **IKEv2 with IPSec**
   * Remote address: Use the server name or remote IP of your Azure VPN
   * Remote ID: Use the Remote ID you located earier.
   * Server Certificate Roots: Choose "Upload external root" and upload the `VpnServerRoot.pem` file you created earlier.

5. Choose "Save account"
6. Download your Smallstep Root Certificate from the Authority Settings page.
7. In Azure, follow the instructions in [Upload root certificate public key information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal#uploadfile) to add the Smallstep Root Certifcate to the Root certificates section of your VPN's Point-to-site Configuration.

You're now ready to verify your VPN connection.
