description: This tutorial describes how to configure Smallstep with strongSwan for a high-security, certificate-based VPN server
---

This configuration was tested with strongSwan 5.9.13.

### Configure strongSwan to accept Smallstep-issued Client Certificates

In this section, you'll configure strongSwan to use full EAP-TLS client authentication with Smallstep client certificates.

1. In Smallstep, under the Protect tab, add a VPN resource.
    - Choose strongSwan as the VPN server
    - Add your Remote Address and Remote ID
2. Once you’ve created the VPN resource, download the Root CA Certificate from the VPN Settings page. This is the CA your clients will get certificates from.
3. Copy the Root CA certificate you just downloaded into `/etc/swanctl/x509ca/accounts_root_ca.crt` on your strongSwan servers.
4. In `/etc/swanctl/swanctl.conf`, update the [`connections.<conn>.remote` section](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/swanctl/swanctlConf.html#_connections_conn_remote) to look like:
    
    ```bash
       remote {
          id = %any
          cacerts = accounts_root_ca.crt
          auth = eap-tls
        }
    ```
    
    You can constrain the IKE `id` to match a subject name from the certificate, if you wish. See the [strongSwan documentation](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/swanctl/swanctlConf.html#_connections_conn_remote) for details.
    
5. Restart strongSwan. You now have client EAP-TLS authentication for your VPN!

For testing, you can get a certificate from the Accounts CA using the Smallstep UI. Visit Certificate Manager → Authorities → Smallstep Accounts CA, and get a certificate on that page.

To deploy and manage certificates for strongSwan to all your VPN clients, you can use MDM or the Smallstep agent app.

### Configure strongSwan with a Server TLS Certificate

In this section, you'll configure a strongSwan Server TLS certificate issued from your Smallstep CA.

1. [Install `step-agent`](https://www.notion.so/Install-the-Smallstep-agent-on-a-Linux-device-2a161d11bb244267aeeb36327c3075fb?pvs=21) on a VPN server, and make sure it is running as a service and is connected to Smallstep.
2. Add a Workload Collection for your strongSwan server, selecting Custom Client and Server as the Workload Type.
3. When creating the Workload Collection, use Advanced Settings to select the following:
   * Key Type: 2048-bit RSA (for maximum compatibility)
   * Server certificate location: `/etc/swanctl/x509/vpn.crt`
   * Server key location: `/etc/swanctl/private/vpn.key`
   * Reload method: systemd
   * Unit name: `strongswan.service`
    
   You may need to adjust the user, group, or file locations to match your specific OS and distribution.
    
4. Deploy the new Workload Collection.
5. Confirm that the Smallstep-managed certificate and private key for strongSwan appear on the VM, in `/etc/swanctl/x509/vpn.crt` and `/etc/swanctl/private/vpn.key`. These will be managed and renewed by the `step-agent` process.
6. The `vpn.crt` file is a PEM bundle containing the server certificate and the Workloads Intermediate CA certificate. **strongSwan will only read the first certificate in `vpn.crt`. So, the Intermediate CA certificate will need to be in a separate file.**
    
    Run the following to separate the two certificates:
    
    ```bash
    sudo cat /etc/swanctl/x509/vpn.crt | sudo awk 'split_after==1{n++;split_after=0}
           /-----END CERTIFICATE-----/{split_after=1}
          n==1{print > "/etc/swanctl/x509ca/intermediate.crt"}'
    ```
    
    Run `step certificate inspect` to confirm that your Intermediate CA certificate was written to `/etc/swanctl/x509ca/intermediate.crt`.
    
7. Now let’s configure strongSwan to use your new server TLS certificate. In `/etc/swanctl/swanctl.conf`, your [`connections.<conn>.local` section](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/swanctl/swanctlConf.html#_connections_conn_local) should look like:
    
    ```bash
        local {
          auth = eap-tls
          certs = vpn.crt
          cacerts = intermediate.crt
          id = vpn.example.com
        }
    ```
    
    The `cacerts` file is the Workload Intermediate CA certificate, for strongSwan to send in the TLS handshake. This allows the client to complete a trust chain back to the Workloads Root CA, which must be trusted by all clients (this is handled by Smallstep’s agent app).
    
    The `id` value should match the Subject Common Name in your server certificate.
    
8. Restart strongSwan.


You should now have server authentication enabled.
